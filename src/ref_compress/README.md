`jsonlz4` - Reference compressor to the same non standard lz4-based format which
Firefox uses for its bookmark backups.

This tool is here for reference only, and it's not fully tested. It's not
recommended to use it since we don't want to create files in a non standard
format, even if Firefox does so too.
